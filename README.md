```markdown
# urban-node-web

A symbolic operating system for activating modular intelligence across distributed environments.  
It orchestrates smart recommendations and scalable deployment through symbolic interfaces, cards, and nodes.  
The site is a gateway for activating urban, commercial, and educational units via `JuKiChin.Trigger()`.

---

## 🔧 Purpose

This repository hosts the front-end interface for symbolic activation nodes within the JuKiChin Smart Store System.  
It enables decentralized deployment of AI models, operational scenarios, and modular tools across urban environments.

## 🚀 Activation Logic

Each component in this interface is designed to be triggered via symbolic logic, using:

- `JuKiChin.Trigger()` for activating modules  
- `SymbolicCard()` for rendering operational roles  
- `NodeMap()` for visualizing deployment across distributed cells

---

## 📡 Deployment

This interface can be hosted via GitHub Pages or integrated into larger symbolic systems.  
It supports modular expansion and can be linked to other JuKiChin nodes such as:

- `solvagrid-node`  
- `eco-node`  
- `learn-node`

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

JuKiChin is not a product. It’s a symbolic logic engine for turning ideas into executable models.  
This repository reflects that philosophy by offering a replicable, adaptable, and symbolic interface for smart urban activation.
